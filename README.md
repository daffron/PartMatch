# About

This is a peer to peer market place I have coded from scratch to improve my javascript skills, it is still in the very early stages with the implementation of Redux to come next. The goal is the create a free to use substitute of paid marketplaces to reduce the amount of scams that occur on the Facebook buy and sell pages.
I also want it to include a wanted section, that can make users to people that are selling the same part and vice versa.
